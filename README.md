[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) is becoming more and more popular, so u want to learn it. but wait, so many new thoughts, so many new APIs, while so little Demos!

Don't panic, here are some simple snippets u may find easier to follow and understand.

if u find shit in code or want to add more snippets, please add an issue or PR, thanks.

PS: all snippets are based on ReactiveCocoa 2.

PPS: pods are included in the project, so u don't need to `pod install`, just open RAC-Snippets.xcworkspace
